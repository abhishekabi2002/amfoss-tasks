# S.Abhishek Hereby...!!!

💥I am the first year B-Tech student in Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham.

💥I am from TamilNadu.And my native is Kanyakumari. I was born and grown up in a Rural area and i didnt have much oppurtunities.

💥Then I started to explore the world and then realized my level in this Competitive world.Because of that I started learning the more apart from my academics.And I found very interesting about the FOSS club in QUORA.Then I decided to join the Club..Finally I found the way..And that's the AMRITA AMRITAPURI CAMPUS.

💥I started to search more about the club and started to follow the aluminies.

💎The only thing which is common in all of them is that " There should be a fond of learning ".

💎On the first day of my class many started to discourage me as I am from the rural.Then I started to learn something more than them.And believes that the learning never stops..😊😊😊.

💎I studied CS stream in TAMILNADU And the Syllabus named "SAMACHEER KALVI".

💎I scored 99% in COMPUTER in my HSC.

💥The thing is that i am lacking the coding knowledge and now only I began to learn coding.

💥Done the tasks 0 and 01.

💥From the crash I am learning...

💥Learning some exercises and I believe that I will be a good programmer in the upcoming years...

💛Thankyou💛 for your ❤kind❤ support and cooperation in both ❤Telegram❤ group and in private chats...🤝🤝.
