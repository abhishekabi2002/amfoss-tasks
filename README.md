# S.Abhishek Hereby...!!!

I was born and raised in the heart of Tamilnadu and grew up as a very outgoing and active child. 
I aspire to receive a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham ( Amritapuri Campus ). 
I was involved in campus activities and organized many team works during my Intermediate. 
I can drive new and innovative ideas, taking an iterative approach to continually learning and optimizing. 
I wish to explore the world to solve technical problems and unite the ideas of math with the efficiency of computers to solve problems in our complex world. 
My desire is to reach towards a higher standard and prove to myself that I have the talents and skills to realize my dreams, while also setting a positive example for those that come behind me. 
I keep myself updated with technical kinds of stuff to learn new things.
