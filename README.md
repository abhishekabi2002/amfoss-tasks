# S.ABHISHEK Here By....!!!!

I am the first year B-Tech student in Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham.

I am from TamilNadu.And my native is Kanyakumari.

I studied CS stream in TAMILNADU And the Syllabus named "SAMACHEER KALVI".

I scored 99% in COMPUTER in my HSC.

The thing is that i am lacking the coding knowledge and now only I began to learn coding.

Done the tasks 0 and 01.

From the crash I am learning...

Learning some exercises and I believe that I will be a good programmer in the upcoming years...

Thankyou for your kind support and cooperation in both Telegram group and in private chats...🤝🤝👏👏👏👏
