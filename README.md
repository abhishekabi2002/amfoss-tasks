# S.Abhishek Hereby...!!!

I am the first year B-Tech student in Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham.

I am from TamilNadu.And my native is Kanyakumari. I was born and grown up in a Rural area and i didnt have much oppurtunities.

Then I started to explore the world and then realized my level in this Competitive world.Because of that I started learning the more apart from my academics.And I found very interesting about the FOSS club in QUORA.Then I decided to join the Club..Finally I found the way..And that's the AMRITA AMRITAPURI CAMPUS.

I started to search more about the club and started to follow the aluminies.

The only thing which is common in all of them is that " There should be a fond of learning ".

On the first day of my class many started to discourage me as I am from the rural.Then I started to learn something more than them.And believes that the learning never stops..😊😊😊.

I studied CS stream in TAMILNADU And the Syllabus named "SAMACHEER KALVI".

I scored 99% in COMPUTER in my HSC.

The thing is that i am lacking the coding knowledge and now only I began to learn coding.

Done the tasks 0 and 01.

From the crash I am learning...

Learning some exercises and I believe that I will be a good programmer in the upcoming years...

Thankyou for your kind support and cooperation in both Telegram group and in private chats...🤝🤝
